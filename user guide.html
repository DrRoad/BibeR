<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>To <strong>provide an easier way to summarise your customed scientific literature library</strong>, I developed this tool and shared with my colleagues. Now, I decide to share with you, presenting a thought of what I and R language can contribute to bibliometric analysis which is "widely" used by librarians and small group of scientists.</p>

<h1>How to use it?</h1>

<p><strong>Note: a subscribed access to Web of Science is required.</strong></p>

<p>Please follow the steps:</p>

<p>First of all, make sure you select the "Web of Science Core collection", otherwise inadequate information would be extracted.</p>

<p><em><strong>Step 1: select the "Web of Science Core collection" database</strong></em></p>

<p>You'd better search certain keywords that could represent a certain research field (this is on your own, not included in this tutorial) in Web of Science Core collection database. Then save the records on your computer.</p>

<p><em><strong>Step 2: search and save .txt file in a right way.</strong></em></p>

<p><emphasis>You could drag and resize your browser (at least IE9+ and other popular browsers) to take a look at these charts, because I set up the width 800 pixels. Hope you enjoy them!</emphasis></p>
